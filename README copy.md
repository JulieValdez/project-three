  1. It is a blog-style social media app for neighbors in a community where users can share posts that can be useful. blah blah blah....

     * Post blog articles! Let your neighbors in your community know what you are up to.

     * Give props - this will increase user score and article score

     * Post services - share what services you want to provide to help those nearby whether you want to get paid or not.

     * Comment and connect with those nearby that you cannot get in close physical contact with due to pandemics.

  2. Users are able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments are saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. Users are also able to delete comments left on articles. All stored comments should be visible to every user.
